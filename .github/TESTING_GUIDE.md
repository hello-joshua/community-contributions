# Testing Guide for Adaptive PR Workflow

This guide explains how to test the adaptive PR workflow system after implementation.

## Prerequisites for Testing

Before testing, ensure:
- [ ] All workflow files are committed to your fork
- [ ] GitHub Actions are enabled in repository settings
- [ ] You have access to create PRs from different accounts
- [ ] (Optional) Slack webhooks are configured for notifications

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Small PR - Happy Path

**Objective**: Verify small PR workflow with passing validation

**Steps**:
1. Create a new branch with a small change:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test-small-pr
   echo "# Test" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Docs: Add test line to README"
   git push origin test-small-pr
   ```

2. Open PR from a non-member account
   - Use GitHub's "Create Pull Request" from the branch
   - Or fork → create PR from fork

3. Fill out PR template selecting:
   - Type: 📝 Documentation
   - Size: 🟢 Small

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] PR labeled with `pr/external`
- [ ] PR labeled with `size:small` and `pr-category:docs`
- [ ] Bot comment explaining workflow
- [ ] Validation workflow runs
- [ ] All checks pass (or skip if no linters configured)
- [ ] Squad notification sent (if Slack configured)
- [ ] Status check shows ✅

**Timeline**: Should complete within 2-5 minutes

### Test 2: Medium PR - With Failing Tests

**Objective**: Verify medium PR handles validation failures

**Steps**:
1. Create a branch with moderate changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test-medium-pr
   # Make changes to 5-8 files, 200-300 lines
   # Intentionally don't add tests
   git add .
   git commit -m "Feature: Add new dashboard component"
   git push origin test-medium-pr
   ```

2. Open PR selecting:
   - Type: ✨ Feature
   - Size: 🟡 Medium

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] PR labeled with `size:medium` and `pr-category:feature`
- [ ] Bot comment about comprehensive validation
- [ ] Validation runs
- [ ] Validation fails due to missing tests
- [ ] Bot comment lists specific failures
- [ ] Instructions provided to fix
- [ ] No squad notification (validation not passed)

**Fix and Re-test**:
1. Add test files
2. Push changes
3. Validation should re-run automatically
4. Should pass and notify squad

### Test 3: Large PR - Early Alignment

**Objective**: Verify large PR requests early human review

**Steps**:
1. Create branch with major changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test-large-pr
   # Make changes to 15+ files, 600+ lines
   # Implement a significant feature
   git add .
   git commit -m "Feature: Complete dashboard redesign"
   git push origin test-large-pr
   ```

2. Open PR selecting:
   - Type: ✨ Feature
   - Size: 🔴 Large

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] PR labeled with `size:large`
- [ ] Bot comment requesting early alignment
- [ ] Label `awaiting-alignment` added
- [ ] Squad notified immediately
- [ ] NO automated validation runs yet
- [ ] Comment explains to wait for human review

**Continue Test**:
1. Have a maintainer add `alignment-approved` label
2. Validation should trigger automatically
3. Lighter validation (smoke tests only)
4. Second squad notification when complete

---

### Test 4: Category Conflict

**Objective**: Verify auto-detection overrides incorrect self-selection

**Steps**:
1. Create small change (< 50 lines)
2. In PR template, select:
   - Size: 🔴 Large (intentionally wrong)

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Bot detects conflict
- [ ] Applies correct size (`size:small`)
- [ ] Comment warns about mismatch
- [ ] Explains auto-detection reasoning

---

### Test 5: Slack Notifications

**Objective**: Verify squad notifications work (requires Slack setup)

**Prerequisites**:
- Slack webhooks configured
- Secrets added to repository

**Steps**:
1. Create any PR that passes validation
2. Wait for squad notification

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Slack message appears in correct channel
- [ ] Message includes:
  - PR link
  - Author
  - Category (size + type)
  - Validation status
  - "View PR" button
- [ ] Clicking button opens PR

---

### Test 6: Multiple Workflows (Stress Test)

**Objective**: Verify system handles multiple concurrent PRs

**Steps**:
1. Open 3-5 PRs simultaneously:
   - Mix of small, medium, large
   - Different types (docs, feature, bugfix)

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] All PRs categorized correctly
- [ ] No workflow collisions
- [ ] Each PR gets appropriate validation
- [ ] All notifications sent correctly
- [ ] No duplicate comments

---

## Manual Testing Checklist

After automated tests, manually verify:

### Categorization System
- [ ] Small PRs (< 100 lines) categorized correctly
- [ ] Medium PRs (100-500 lines) categorized correctly
- [ ] Large PRs (> 500 lines) categorized correctly
- [ ] Docs PRs identified by file paths
- [ ] Feature PRs identified correctly
- [ ] Bugfix PRs identified correctly

### Validation Workflows
- [ ] Small: Lightweight checks only
- [ ] Medium: Comprehensive validation
- [ ] Large: Early alignment before validation
- [ ] Test verification works
- [ ] Linting checks work (if configured)
- [ ] PR requirements checker works

### User Experience
- [ ] PR template is clear
- [ ] Bot comments are helpful
- [ ] Error messages are actionable
- [ ] Workflow transitions are smooth
- [ ] No confusing or duplicate messages

### Squad Notifications
- [ ] Correct squad identified
- [ ] Notifications sent at right time
- [ ] Message format is clear
- [ ] Links work correctly

## Integration Testing

### Test with Real External Contributors

1. Announce testing period in community channels
2. Invite external contributors to submit test PRs
3. Monitor their experience
4. Collect feedback via:
   - GitHub comments
   - Slack messages
   - Survey (Google Form)

### Feedback Questions

Ask contributors:
- Was the categorization accurate?
- Were bot messages helpful?
- Was the process clear?
- How long did review take?
- Any confusion or frustration?
- Suggestions for improvement?

## Performance Testing

### Metrics to Monitor

Track these metrics for 2-4 weeks:

**Volume**:
- Total external PRs
- PRs per category
- PRs per type

**Quality**:
- % passing initial validation
- % requiring fixes
- Average iterations to pass

**Timing**:
- Time to categorization
- Time to validation complete
- Time to first human review
- Time to merge

**Squad Response**:
- Notification delivery success rate
- Squad response time after notification
- Response time by category

## Troubleshooting Tests

### Workflow Doesn't Run

Check:
- GitHub Actions enabled?
- Correct trigger (`pull_request_target`)?
- PR from external account?
- Workflow file syntax valid?

Debug:
```bash
# Validate workflow syntax
act -l  # if using 'act' locally
# Or check Actions tab for errors
```

### Categorization Wrong

Check:
- Changed files count
- Lines changed count
- Labels already applied
- File paths match patterns

Debug: Look at workflow logs in Actions tab

### Validation Fails

Check:
- Are dependencies installed?
- Do tests exist?
- Is code formatted correctly?
- Are all tools available?

Debug: Run commands locally:
```bash
yarn lint  # for frontend
go test ./...  # for backend
```

### Notifications Not Sent

Check:
- Webhook secret configured?
- Secret name matches squad-mapping.json?
- Webhook URL valid?
- Channel exists?

Debug: Test webhook manually:
```bash
curl -X POST YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text": "Test message"}'
```

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues found during testing:

1. **Immediate**: Disable workflow
   ```yaml
   # Add to top of external-pr-automation.yml
   on:
     workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger only
   ```

2. **Quick Fix**: Fix issue and re-enable

3. **Major Issues**: Revert to previous state
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push
   ```

4. **Communication**: Notify contributors of any issues

## Success Criteria

Consider testing successful when:

- [ ] All automated tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing checklist complete
- [ ] Real PRs processed successfully
- [ ] Positive contributor feedback
- [ ] No critical bugs found
- [ ] Squad satisfaction with notifications
- [ ] Metrics showing improvement over baseline

## Next Steps After Testing

1. Document any issues found
2. Make necessary adjustments
3. Run final verification
4. Announce to community
5. Monitor for first 2 weeks
6. Collect feedback
7. Iterate based on learnings

---

**Testing Duration**: Plan for 1-2 weeks of testing before full rollout

**Who Should Test**:
- Maintainers (you)
- Friendly external contributors
- Each squad representative

**When to Test**:
- After initial implementation
- After any major changes
- Quarterly for regression testing
