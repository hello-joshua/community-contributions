Hey! Thanks for this substantial documentation contribution!

### Phase 1: Early alignment
For large documentation changes, we first want to align on the structure and approach before diving into detailed review.

**What's happening:**
- A squad member will review the overall structure and approach
- Once aligned, we'll add the `alignment-approved` label

### Phase 2: Validation (after alignment)

#### Automated checks (we monitor these)
- [ ] Vale prose linting

#### What we look for

- Information architecture makes sense
- Clear navigation and organization
