## 🤖 Automated PR analysis

Thank you for your contribution to Grafana! We want to make it easier for both community contributors and engineers, so we're going to help you get your PR super ready before human review so your chances of getting it merged increase.

Your PR has been categorized based on its size and type:

| Category | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Size** | __SIZE__ |
| **Type** | __TYPE__ |

# Add size-specific Review Process section
if [ "$SIZE" = "small" ]; then
  cat >> /tmp/pr-analysis-comment.md << 'EOF'
**Review process**
1. Automated validation (linting, code formatting, tests, requirements)
1. AI review
1. Human review for final approval

EOF
elif [ "$SIZE" = "medium" ]; then
  cat >> /tmp/pr-analysis-comment.md << 'EOF'
**Review process**
1. Automated validation (linting, code formatting, tests, requirements)
1. Comprehensive AI review (code quality, security, best practices)
1. Automatically routed to the relevant squad based on affected areas
1. Human review required before merge

EOF
elif [ "$SIZE" = "large" ]; then
  cat >> /tmp/pr-analysis-comment.md << 'EOF'
**Review process**
1. Early alignment checkpoint: A squad member reviews your approach first
1. Discussion about implementation strategy
1. Once aligned, comprehensive validation runs
1. Detailed human code review after alignment

⚠️ **Important for large PRs**: We want to ensure your effort is well-directed before you invest significant time. A maintainer will review the architectural approach and provide feedback. Once we add the `alignment-approved` label, automated validation will proceed.
