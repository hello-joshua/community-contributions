Thanks for your contribution! This is a substantial PR, so we'll start with early alignment.

### What happens next

1. **Early alignment** - A squad member will review your approach first
2. **Once aligned** - We'll add the \`alignment-approved\` label
3. **Automated checks** will run (we monitor existing CI/CD)
4. **Code review** - An automation leaves inline comments; fix directly in GitHub and mark resolved when done
5. **Final approval** by a squad member

### What you can do now

- **Add context** about your implementation approach
- **Be ready to discuss** the design with a squad member
- Wait for alignment before addressing detailed feedback
